      # Dynatrace Operator

      The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle management of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.

      * OneAgent
      * `classicFullStack` rolls out a OneAgent pod per node to monitor pods on it and the node itself
      * `applicationMonitoring` is a webhook based injection mechanism for automatic app-only injection
      * CSI Driver can be enabled to cache OneAgent downloads per node
      * `hostMonitoring` is only monitoring the hosts (i.e. nodes) in the cluster without app-only injection
      * `cloudNativeFullStack` is a combination of `applicationMonitoring` with CSI driver and `hostMonitoring`
      * ActiveGate
      * `routing` routes OneAgent traffic through the ActiveGate
      * `kubernetes-monitoring` allows monitoring of the Kubernetes API
      * `metrics-ingest` routes enriched metrics through ActiveGate
