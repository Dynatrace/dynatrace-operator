# Dynatrace Operator

The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.

As of launch, the Dynatrace Operator can be used to deploy a containerized ActiveGate for Kubernetes API monitoring. New capabilities will be added to the Dynatrace Operator over time including metric routing, and API monitoring for AWS, Azure, GCP, and vSphere.
