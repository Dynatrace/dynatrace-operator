      v0.4.0

      Self registering ActiveGate to no longer require manually adding Kubernetes API
      enable by setting following feature flag on a Dynakube with kubernetes-monitoring capability:

      annotations:
        ...
        alpha.operator.dynatrace.com/feature-automatic-kubernetes-api-monitoring: "true"
      To be able to read and update the settings on the Dynatrace tenant, the apiToken needs additional scopes
      additional Scopes for apiToken: Read Entities


      When OneAgent is injected, the file required for metadata enrichment is automatically created on each instrumented pod
      enabled by default (when applicationMonitoring or cloudNativeFullStack is used)
      can be disabled by setting the following feature flag on the Dynakube:

      annotations:
        ...
        alpha.operator.dynatrace.com/feature-disable-metadata-enrichment: "true"
      To be able to send the metrics to the Dynatrace tenant, the dataIngestToken has to be added to the tokens secret
      required scopes for dataIngestToken: Ingest metrics


      paasToken is no longer required
      additional scopes for apiToken: Installer download
      existing installations with both apiToken and paasToken will continue to work as before


      PREVIEW: ActiveGate has a new capability metrics-ingest that can be used to route enriched metrics over ActiveGate instead of directly to Dynatrace tenant
      enabled by adding the capability to the ActiveGate
