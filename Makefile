# Running 'make' runs the first rule in the makefile
# In order to print the help text in this case,

# The position of a 'default' target that prints a help screen is a

# If there is no such comment line, e.g., "## Prints a help screen", the target is not printed at all

# Code breakdown:
# '/^[a-zA-Z\-_0-9%:\\]+/ Match every line that is neither a comment nor a command, i.e. only targets
# helpMessage = match(lastLine, /^## (.*)/); If `lastLine` starts with `## ` it is assumed to be a help message
# if (helpMessage) { If it is indeed a help message
# 	helpCommand = $$1; Then the command it describes is in the next line
#   helpMessage = substr(lastLine, RSTART + 3, RLENGTH); \  Remove the `## ` from the help comment
#   gsub("\\\\", "", helpCommand); \ Remove `\\` from the command string
#   gsub(":+$$", "", helpCommand); \ Remove the colon and everything past it from the command string
#   printf
#  		"  \x1b[32;01m Escape code to set the output color to green
#		%-35s Print the first argument and truncate to 35 characters
#  		\x1b[0m Reset the output color
#		%s\n", helpCommand, helpMessage; Print the second argument, supply command and message as arguments
# { lastLine = $$0 }' Iterates through every line and assigns it to `lastLine`
# $(MAKEFILE_LIST) Holds the filenames to every Makefile so `awk` can iterate through it
