# Dynatrace Operator

The Dynatrace Operator supports rollout and lifecycle management of various Dynatrace components in Kubernetes and OpenShift.

* OneAgent
  * `classicFullStack` rolls out a OneAgent pod per node to monitor pods on it and the node itself
  * `applicationMonitoring` is a webhook based injection mechanism for automatic app-only injection
    * CSI Driver can be enabled to cache OneAgent downloads per node
  * `hostMonitoring` is only monitoring the hosts (i.e. nodes) in the cluster without app-only injection
  * `cloudNativeFullStack` is a combination of `applicationMonitoring` with CSI driver and `hostMonitoring`
* ActiveGate
  * `routing` routes OneAgent traffic through the ActiveGate
  * `kubernetes-monitoring` allows monitoring of the Kubernetes API
  * `metrics-ingest` routes enriched metrics through ActiveGate

our [official help page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/kubernetes-hub).

## Supported lifecycle

As the Dynatrace Operator is provided by Dynatrace Incorporated, support is provided by the Dynatrace Support team, as described on the [support page](https://support.dynatrace.com/).
Github issues will also be considered on a case-by-case basis regardless of support contracts and commercial relationships with Dynatrace.

The Dynatrace Operator's support lifecycle guarantees that the latest Kubernetes and OpenShift platforms are fully supported within 4 weeks of their release unless release notes state otherwise.
These versions will be supported for a period of nine months, or until two releases ("N-2") occur in Kubernetes and OpenShift projects, whichever period is longer.

OpenShift 3.11 is an exception to the Dynatrace Operator support lifecyle and will be supported with Operator v0.2.2 until end of 2022.

## Quick Start

The Dynatrace Operator acts on its separate namespace `dynatrace`. It holds the operator deployment and all dependent
objects like permissions, custom resources and corresponding StatefulSets.

### Installation

> For install instructions on Openshift, head to the
> [official help page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/full-stack-dto-k8)

To create the namespace and apply the operator run the following commands

```sh
$ kubectl create namespace dynatrace
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-operator/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
```

If using `cloudNativeFullStack` or `applicationMonitoring` with CSI driver, the following command is required as well:
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-operator/releases/latest/download/kubernetes-csi.yaml
```

A secret holding tokens for authenticating to the Dynatrace cluster needs to be created upfront. Create access tokens of
type *Dynatrace API* and use its values in the following commands respectively. For
assistance please refer
to [Create user-generated access tokens](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/token#create-api-token).

The token scopes required by the Dynatrace Operator are documented on our [official help page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/setup-and-configuration/setup-on-container-platforms/kubernetes/get-started-with-kubernetes-monitoring#tokens)

```sh
$ kubectl -n dynatrace create secret generic dynakube --from-literal="apiToken=DYNATRACE_API_TOKEN" --from-literal="dataIngestToken=DATA_INGEST_TOKEN"
```

#### Create `DynaKube` custom resource for ActiveGate and OneAgent rollout

The rollout of the Dynatrace components is governed by a custom resource of type `DynaKube`. This custom resource will
contain parameters for various Dynatrace capabilities (OneAgent deployment mode, ActiveGate capabilities, etc.)

> Note: `.spec.tokens` denotes the name of the secret holding access tokens.
>
> If not specified Dynatrace Operator searches for a secret called like the DynaKube custom resource `.metadata.name`.

The recommended approach is using classic Fullstack injection to roll out Dynatrace to your cluster, available as [classicFullStack sample](assets/samples/classicFullStack.yaml).
In case you want to have adjustments please have a look at [our DynaKube Custom Resource examples](assets/samples).

Save one of the sample configurations, change the API url to your environment and apply it to your cluster.
```sh
$ kubectl apply -f cr.yaml
```

## Uninstall dynatrace-operator

> For instructions on how to uninstall the dynatrace-operator on Openshift, head to the [official help page](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/full-stack-dto-k8#uninstall-dynatrace-operator)

Clean-up all Dynatrace Operator specific objects:
```sh
$ kubectl delete -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-operator/releases/latest/download/kubernetes.yaml
```

If the CSI driver was installed, the following command is required as well:
```sh
$ kubectl delete -f https://github.com/Dynatrace/dynatrace-operator/releases/latest/download/kubernetes-csi.yaml
```
