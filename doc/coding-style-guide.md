## General

- Use descriptive names (`namespace` is better than `ns`, `dynakube` is better than `dk`, etc.)
- Avoid using `client.Client` for 'getting' resources, use `client.Reader` (also known as `apiReader`) instead.
  - `client.Client` uses a cache (or tries to) that requires more permissions than normally, and can also give you outdated results.
- Do not create methods with more than two parameters (in extremely rare occasions maybe three) except constructors and factory functions. Structs and interfaces exist for a reason.
- Avoid returning responses (e.g., reconcile.Result, admission.Patched) in anything but Reconcile or Handle functions.

## Function Parameter and Return-Value Order

Ordering of **function parameters** should be:

1. Convention
   - example: `ctx context.Context`
2. Interfaces
   - example: `kubeClient client.Client`
3. Data Structs
   - example: `pod corev1.Pod`
4. Simple/base types
   - example: `data string`

Ordering of **return values** is more straightforward; the `err error` should always be the last, and AVOID returning more than two values. If more than two return values are needed, try splitting the logic or collecting the return values in a `struct`.

So a full example: `func ExampleFunc(ctx context.Context, kubeClient client.Client, pod corev1.Pod, data string) (corev1.Pod, error) {...}`

## Cuddling of statements

Statements must be cuddled, i.e., written as a single block, if an `if`-statement directly follows a single assignment and the condition is directly related to the assignment.
This commonly occurs with error handling, but is not restricted to it.
Example:

```go
err := assignment1()
if err != nil {
  do()
}

value1 := assignment2()
if value1 {
  do()
}
```

Statements must not be cuddled with each other if multiple of the same type of statements follow each other.
A statement must be cuddled with following statements, if they are of the same type.
Example:

```go
value1 := assignment1()
value2 := assignment2()
value3, err := assignment3()

if err != nil {
  do()
}
if value1 == "something" {
  do()
}
if value2 {
  do()
}
```

## Reconciler vs Controller

### A **Controller** is a struct that **DIRECTLY** handles the reconcile Requests

Important characteristics:

- We pass it to `ctrl.NewControllerManagedBy(mgr)`
- Has a `Reconcile(ctx context.Context, request reconcile.Request) (reconcile.Result, error)` function.
- Calls other Reconcilers when needed
- Examples: DynakubeController, WebhookCertController, NodesController, OneAgentProvisioner, CSIGarbageCollector

### A **Reconciler** is a struct that **INDIRECTLY** handles the reconcile Requests

Important characteristics:

- Has a `Reconcile(<whatever is necessary>)` function
- Is called/used BY a Controller
  - Examples: OneAgentReconciler, IstioReconciler...
- `Reconciler`s don't hold state in a way that they need to be passed around, or if they currently do, they shouldn't.
  - Configuring a `struct` once a reusing it makes sense IF the creation was costly. (example: required an API call)
    - A `Reconciler` shouldn't be this kind of struct, it should be "throw away struct."
- The cleanup for the resources that are created by the `Reconciler` are cleaned up by the same `Reconciler`
  - The cleanup is "invisible" for the caller of the `Reconciler`, so its up to the `Reconciler` to decide if it needs to clean up or setup/update.
    - Example: `DynakubeController` should just call the `ActiveGateReconciler.Reconcile` function, and not worry about if it will create(i.e.: setup) a `StatefulSet` or delete(i.e.: cleanup) the no longer necessary one.

## Errors

### Do's

- Follow on how to [working with Errors in Go 1.13](https://go.dev/blog/go1.13-errors)
- Expected errors should be designed as error values (sentinel errors): `var ErrFoo = errors. New ("foo")`.

>[Sentinel errors](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73433300/what-is-the-difference-between-errors-and-sentinel-errors) are user defined errors that indicated very specific events that you, as a developer, anticipate & identify as adequately important to define and specify.
As such, you declare them at the package level and, in doing so, imply that your package functions may return these errors (thereby committing you in the future to maintain these errors as others depending on your package will be checking for them).

- Unexpected errors should be designed as error types: `type BarError struct { ...}`, with `BarError` implementing the error interface.
- If an error is returned by an external function from an external package, it must be wrapped with `errors.WithStack()`.
- If an error is instantiated by internal code, it must be instantiated with `errors.New()`
- If an error is returned by an internal function and propagated, it must be propagated as is and must **not** be wrapped with `errors.WithStack()`.
  - The stacktrace is already complete when `errors.New` is called, wrapping it with `errors.WithStack()` convolutes it.
- If the error is not propagated to the controller or reconciler, it should be logged at the point where it is not returned to the caller.

### Don'ts

- Errors that are propagated to the controller or reconciler must not be logged directly by us, as they get automatically logged by the Operator-SDK framework.
  - So we do not log errors twice.
  - Example:

```go
// Doing something like this:
err = errors.New("BOOM!")
if err != nil {
    log.Error(err, "it happened")
    return reconcile.Result{}, err
}
// Will result in: (shortened it a bit so its not huge)

## Logging

### Do's

- Use a package global `logger` (1 per package), should be named `log` and be declared in the `config.go` of the package. (temporary solution)
  - In case of larger packages it's advisable to introduce separate loggers for different parts of the package, these sub-loggers should still be derived from the main logger of the package and given a name.
    - Example: in webhook/mutation `var nsLog = log.WithName("namespace")` (the name of this logger is `mutation-webhook.namespace`)
- Use the logger defined in the `dynatrace-operator/src/logger` and always give it a name.
  - The name of the logger (given via `.WithName("...")`) should use `-` to divide longer names.
  - Example: `var log = logger.Get().WithName("mutation-webhook")`

### Don'ts

- Don't use `fmt.Sprintf` for creating log messages, the values you wish to replace via `Sprintf` should be provided to the logger as key-value pairs.
  - Example: `log.Info("deleted volume info", "ID", volume.VolumeID, "PodUID", volume.PodName, "Version", volume.Version, "TenantUUID", volume.TenantUUID)`
- Don't start a log message with uppercase characters, unless it's a name of an exact proper noun.

## Testing

### Do's

- Write unit-tests ;)
- Use `assert` and `require`. (`github.com/stretchr/testify/assert, github.com/stretchr/testify/require`)
- `require` is your friend, use it for checking errors (`require.NoError(t, err)`) or anywhere where executing the rest of the `assert`s in case of the check failing would just be noise in the output.
- Abstract the setup/assert phase as much as possible so it can be reused in other tests in the package.
- Use `t.Run` and give a title that describes what you are testing in that run.
- Use `context.Background` when a context is needed, use `context.TODO` ONLY for actual TODOs. (example: you want to create a special context here later to test something specific)
- Use `<...>mock` as package import alias, in all cases, even if no alias would strictly be necessary.
  - Examples: `dtclientmock`, `controllermock`, `dtbuildermock`, `injectionmock`, `registrymock`
- Use this structure: (or table-tests)

```go
func TestMyFunction(t *testing.T) {
    // Common setup, used for multiple cases
    testString := "test"

    // Each test case of a function gets a t.Run
    t.Run(`useful title`, func(t *testing.T) {
        // Arrange/Setup
        testInt := 1

        // Act
        out, err := MyFunction(testString, testInt)

        // Assert
        require.Nil(t, err)
        assert.Equal(t, out, testString)
    })

    t.Run(`other useful title`, func(t *testing.T) {
        // Arrange
        testInt := 4

        // Act
        out, err := MyFunction(testString, testInt)

        // Assert
        require.Error(t, err)
        assert.Empty(t, out)
    })
}
```

### Don'ts

- Don't name the testing helper functions/variables/constants in a way that could be confused with actual functions. (e.g. add `test` to the beginning)
- Avoid magic ints/strings/... where possible, give names to your values and try to reuse them where possible
- Don't name test functions like `TestMyFunctionFirstCase`, instead use single `TestMyFunction` test function with multiple `t.Run` cases in it that have descriptive names.

## E2E testing guide

We are using the [e2e-framework](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/e2e-framework) package to write our E2E tests.

This framework allows the user a lot of ways to write/structure their tests. Therefore we had to agree on how we are going to structure our tests, otherwise it would be just a convoluted mess.

So here are some basic guidelines:

- Each `TestMain` should test a single `features.Feature`
  - Good Example: `test/scenarios/classic/classic_test.go`
  - Bad Example: `test/scenarios/cloudnative/basic/cloudnative_test.go` (should be refactored)
  - Reason: So you can easily run the tests 1-by-1.
- Test cases are defined as a single `features.Feature`
  - Reason: In a `features.Feature` you can define Setup - Assess - Teardown steps, in a nice way.
    - Having the cleanup close to the logic that creates it makes it easier to make sure that everything will be cleaned up/
    - Furthermore it makes it more understandable what a test case does.
- Don't use `Setup` step in a `features.Feature
  - Reason: If a `Setup` test fails, no other step will run, which sound fine, but this includes `Teardown` steps, which is not acceptable.
    - We run the test one after the other on the same cluster daily, so cleanup is essential.
    - So we use `Assess` steps for setting up the environment and checking it.
      - The downside of this that even if we fail during setup, still all test will run needlessly, as they will definitely fail.
      - Still better then no no cleanup.
- Use the `DynaKube` as the "single-source-of-truth" as much as possible
  - Reason: Most things that the operator deploys (name of services and pods, contents of labels, should CSI be used, etc...) depend on the `DynaKube`
  - Also the namespace of the `DynaKube` should be the same as the operator, so it can help how the operator should be deployed
  - This eliminates lots of hardcoded strings and such
- Don't reinvent the wheel, try to use what is already there.
  - If a helper function is almost fits your use case then first just try to "renovate the wheel" and make what is already there better :)

## Code Review

[Common guidelines](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReview)

- (🧑‍🤝‍🧑) 2 approvals per PR is preferred
- (✅) Resolving a comment is the duty of the commenter. (after the comment was addressed)
- (😬) When nitpicking/complaining always provide possible solutions, otherwise avoid commenting about it.
- (🧑‍💻) Run the PR locally/on-your-environment if possible.
  - (🚨) If testing steps not-clear/not-provided notify the creator to improve them
  - (🚦) After running it "locally" notify the creator by commenting `Ran it, practically LGTM` (or something similar) or `Found possible issue ...`
- (📝) Enforce the coding-style-guide, by linking to it. (to the specific line)
  - (🙋) If you feel something is missing/wrong in the style-guide, discuss it with the team, and create PR for it if it was accepted.
- (💥) The `Update branch` button should be pressed only by the creator of the PR, so the reviewer does not cause unexpected `Push rejected` for the creator.
